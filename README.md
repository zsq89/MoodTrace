# MoodTrace
A website helping people record and analyse mood quantatively.

MoodTrace is a website that allows registered users to record their mood values whenever they want. It's like a mood diary.
The mood is quantified as four indices:  pleasure, angry, sorrow, joy.  Each index ranges from 0 to 10.
An overall mood level is calculated as a weighted average of the four moods.
Like a diary, it helps the owner recall their past, and look over their mood trace.

MoodTrace helps people in the way that they can clearly review their mood fluctuation in a certain period, which will help
them analyze and manage their mood better.
